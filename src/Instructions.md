nstructions for LLM Software Developer: Creating an ERC721 Token on Goerli Testnet

Environment setup:
[]Install Node.js (version >=12) and npm (Node Package Manager) on your development machine.
[] Install the Truffle development framework globally using npm: npm install -g truffle
[] Set up a new Truffle project folder: truffle init
[] Install the OpenZeppelin Contracts library: npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

Develop the ERC721 token contract:
[] In the Truffle project folder, create a new Solidity file for the ERC721 token contract, e.g., MyERC721Token.sol.
[] Import the OpenZeppelin Contracts library's ERC721 implementation by adding the following line at the beginning of your contract file: import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
[] Define your custom ERC721 token contract by extending the imported ERC721 implementation, e.g., contract MyERC721Token is ERC721 { }.
[] Implement the required constructor and functions to set up the token, such as minting and burning (if necessary).
[] Add any additional functions or customization based on the specific project requirements.

Configure the Goerli testnet deployment:
[] Sign up for an account on a public Ethereum node provider, such as Infura or Alchemy, and obtain the API key for the Goerli testnet.
[] Install the necessary npm package for HDWalletProvider: npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
[] In the Truffle project folder, create or modify the truffle-config.js file to configure the deployment to the Goerli testnet using the dummy API key input and mnemonic phrase.
[] Configure the compiler settings in the truffle-config.js file to use a compatible version of Solidity based on the imported OpenZeppelin Contracts library.

Compile and deploy the ERC721 token contract:
[] In the Truffle project folder, run the command truffle compile to compile the ERC721 token contract.
[] Verify that the compilation is successful and the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) and bytecode are generated.
[] Run the command truffle migrate --network goerli to deploy the ERC721 token contract to the Goerli testnet using the configured deployment settings.
[] Take note of the ERC721 token contract's deployed address for future reference and interaction.

Test the ERC721 token contract:
[] In the Truffle project folder, create a new JavaScript test file for the ERC721 token contract, e.g., test/MyERC721Token.test.js.
[] Write test cases to verify the functionality of the ERC721 token contract, such as minting, transferring, and burning (if applicable).
[] Run the command truffle test to execute the test cases and ensure the ERC721 token contract behaves as expected.

Interact with the deployed ERC721 token contract:
[] Use a wallet like MetaMask to connect to the Goerli testnet and add the deployed ERC721 token contract using its address.
[] Obtain some Goerli testnet Ether (ETH) from a faucet and perform transactions with the deployed ERC721 token contract, such as minting or transferring tokens.
